# About this repo

This largely not my code. I forced myself to focus on content for once, rather than spending time on finding the perfect system for the perfect design. So I used a template which is close enough to what I wanted, and adjusted it. I might put some more effort in it at some point, but it's not important enough right now.

The day I have plenty of time, I will tidy up the mess around my web presences (yes, plural, hah!), and make a proper site. One that I am really proud of. Until then, this one has to do.

So, move along, nothing to see here.

PS: Thanks to @n33 for saving me a ton of time. You're the best.
